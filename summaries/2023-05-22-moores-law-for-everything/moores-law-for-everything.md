I first heard of this essay during [Ezra Klein's interview with Sam Altman from
2021][1]. From Klein's description of it, I honestly expected the essay to be
mostly about the ways in which Altman imagines that AI will transform society
for the better. I understood that the general premise was that AI would unlock
a phenomenon _like_ [Moore's Law][2] for nearly every sector of the economy;
i.e. all forms of labor would become exponentially cheaper every year thanks to
assistance from AI, to the point that anything you can imagine that was
previously expensive to build or achieve would be democratized.

What I didn't expect is that the essay would be so light on details about how
AI would transform society, while spending much more time proposing tax policy
ideas.

The essay is divided neatly into 5 parts. I'll summarize them here:

1. **The AI Revolution.** Altman asserts that we are entering the fourth major
   technological revolution, following the agricultural, industrial, and
   computational revolutions (I think this last one is often referred to as the
   "information age"). He says more progress will be made in the next 100 years
   than everything humanity has achieved up until now.
2. **Moore's Law for Everything.** Altman predicts that thanks to AI, we will
   reach a point when _everything_ is getting 50% cheaper every 2 years.
3. **Capitalism for Everyone.** Altman predicts that taxing income (which he
   equates with taxing labor) will become increasingly inappropriate and
   ineffective as the AI revolution transforms the economy. He proposes a new
   nation-wide equity fund, based on taxing _capital_ (of companies over a
   certain size) and privately-held _land_, and distributing it to all citizens
   over 18. He argues that this will align citizens' incentives with wanting
   the country as a whole to thrive which will in turn benefit everyone.
4. **Implementation and Troubleshooting.** In this section Altman gets specific
   by doing some napkin math and estimating that a decade after implementation,
   all American citizens would be receiving $13,500 annually from the
   nation-wide equity fund, and that this would provide significantly more
   purchasing power than it does today (thanks to the price of everything
   having decreased significantly during that time). He acknowledges some
   challenges that would likely arise along the way and suggests ways to
   address them.
5. **Shifting to the New System.** Finally, Altman notes that making the changes
   he is proposing all at once would cause some amount of shock; so he suggests
   a more gradual approach that ties the new taxes on capital and land to GDP
   growth (tax rates are increased incrementally each year until GDP has
   increased 50% from when they were first implemented). He believes that
   policymakers will be very popular for supporting this system. Altman
   concludes by saying, "The future can be almost unimaginably great."

I have mixed feelings about this essay. On the one hand, who can argue with the
future being unimaginably great? I also really appreciate that Altman took the
time to "do the math" on his proposal.

On the other hand, I really do wish he spent more time exploring the ways that
AI will concretely make the world better. He gives the example of robots
building a house, and points out that even the robots would be extremely cheap
if they were made by other robots. That's probably the most specific example he
gives. In my opinion, more specific ideas would go a long way towards getting
the reader excited about the future he believes AI will bring, which I think is
at least part of the point of the essay.

Without effectively conveying why we should all be so excited about AI (my gut
says that the majority of readers either already feel this way or don't; the
essay won't change a lot of minds), Altman gets a little too hand-wavy with his
"Capitalism for Everyone" proposal, in my opinion. The rough math seems to kind
of work out, but there are so many unanswered questions. One example for me
would be how we should think about the purchasing power of $13,500 after a
decade compared to the median income of someone today who will be effectively
unemployed in the future. Is Altman confident that Moore's Law for Everything
will make everything _so_ inexpensive that it more than offsets people's loss of
income due to drastic decreases in the cost of labor? The force driving prices
down would be the same force driving wages down and unemployment up.

In fairness, Altman _does_ describe his entire proposal as a _conversation
starter_; so I don't think he believes he has all the answers. Overall I do
think there's a lot to like in what he's saying. But given the risks if things
go wrong, he could probably spend a bit more energy on making a really airtight
case that AI will do (far) more good than harm.
