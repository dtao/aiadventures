AI Adventures
=============

This is a repository intended to document my experiences learning about AI,
covering the subject as comprehensively as I can. I want to understand the
philosophy and history of the academic field and its precursors (as well as
related fields such as neuroscience), but also the state of the art when it
comes to how AI is being both utilized and advanced in the industry.

The method I intend to use is some flavor of the Feynmann Technique: along the
way I will do my best to explain what I am learning to a general audience, and
use my efforts to explain as a mechanism to drive my own learning.
