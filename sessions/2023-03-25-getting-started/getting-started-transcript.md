# Thanks! Now what do you think would be some good topics for me to explore first to start understanding the fundamentals of AI?

Great question! Here are some fundamental topics that you could explore first to begin understanding the basics of AI:

1. Machine Learning: This is the foundation of AI, and understanding how it
   works will be essential to understanding the broader field. Start with
   understanding supervised and unsupervised learning, and then move on to more
   advanced topics like deep learning.
1. Neural Networks: Neural networks are a subset of machine learning that are
   modeled after the structure of the human brain. Understanding how they work
   will give you a solid foundation for understanding deep learning.
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP is an AI application that focuses on
   teaching machines to understand human language. It is used in a wide variety
   of applications, from chatbots to machine translation.

1. Computer Vision: Computer vision is the ability of machines to interpret and
   understand the visual world. It is a crucial component of many AI
   applications, such as self-driving cars and facial recognition.

1. Ethics in AI: It is essential to understand the ethical implications of AI
   and the potential consequences of its misuse. Topics to explore include bias
   in machine learning, AI safety, and the social impact of AI.

These topics are just the beginning, but they will provide you with a solid
foundation for exploring the broader field of AI.
